# RecipeApp
### Ana√Øs dawes

This is my recipe app built using Swift. It is the second project I have done using this programming language and overall I am fairly happy with what I have produced. This app queries a internal database using all four CRUD operations. Ideally, this database would be a real database running on a server but as for the scope of this project, that was not included. In this app, a user can create recipies, delete recipes, update a recipe, and display them. It uses the split screen view to navigate and the UI is responsive to both smaller iPhone devices as well as larger iPad devices.

## What went well
- I successfully used SwiftData to keep persistant data on the app
- I Learned how to do Markdown in Swift
- I created a beautiful UI
- I got really great practice on clean coding practices
- I learned a lot about Swift/Apple form View options (like Picker)
- I used modals
- I implemented a search that searched all recipes by substring
- I created an app icon
- I created two clean model classes
- I played around with code structure a lot to see what was the most organized and helpful

## What did not go well

- Refactoring my UI into smaller modules took a lot of time
- I still would like to use more constants to keep things cleaner
- I had trouble implementing some things like updating categories due to my complicated structure
- I would like to have used an MVVM structure
- It would be nicer if the user did not have to know markdown and could add lists of ingredients or directions individually
