# RecipeApp
### Ana√Øs dawes

This is my recipe app. In this app you are able to keep track of all of your recipes.

## What went well
- I successfully used SwiftData to keep persistant data on the app
- I Learned how to do Markdown
- I created a beautiful UI
- I got really great practice on clean coding practices
- I learned a lot about Swift/Apple form View options (like Picker)
- I used modals
- I implemented a search that searched all recipes by substring
- I created an app icon
- I created two clean model classes
- I played around with code structure a lot to see what was the most organized and helpful

## What did not go well

- Refactoring my UI into smaller modules took a lot of time
- I still would like to use more constants to keep things cleaner
- I had trouble implementing some things like updating categories due to my complicated structure
- I would like to have used an MVVM structure

### Overall Thoughts

I feel like I deserve an A based on how much I feel I have progressed through doing another project.  I put a lot of effort into this, trying my best to get what I needed and more out of it.  I think this was a great project and very customizable to each individuals goals as a programmer.  I am excited to try more of my own swift projects after this and really start to fine-tune my skills!
